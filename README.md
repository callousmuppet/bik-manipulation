This is a collection of images to use to train people to be like Elisabeth Bik, who has a remarkable ability to detect image manipulations. These are sourced from her comments on PubPeer and are all from journals that are open access.

# How to help
You can help by going to the list of her comments on PubPeer:

https://pubpeer.com/search?q=users%3A+%22Elisabeth+m+bik%22+

and getting the images she has marked up with the solutions and saving them in
the `correct` directory, finding the original, un-marked up images and saving
them in the `challenge` directory and updating the `key.csv` file with
information about the images.

## key.csv code book
- `challenge`: name of challenge image
- `correct`: name of correct image
- `pubpeer`: link to PubPeer article
- `journal`: name of journal
- `oa`: open access? (Y for yes, N for no)
- `year`: year of publication
